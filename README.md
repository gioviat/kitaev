# Kitaev

This repository is used to numerically calculate the energy spectrum and topological quantities for the Kitaev chain in an open setting. The Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional system described by a second quantized Hamiltonian 

$$H_\textup{Kit} = -\mu \sum_{n=1}^N c_n^\dagger c_n - t \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}\Bigl(c_{n+1}^\dagger c_n + \text{h.c.}\Bigr) + \Delta \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} (c_nc_{n+1}+\text{h.c.}).$$
